# ImageStitching

Given two or more images of the same scenic view but might be caught from the same or different perspectives of the camera, the resultant image is expected to view the complete scene by merging the images on the basis of common image parts between one-another. It is also known as image stitching.
In this code, we will merge two images to form a panorama using OpenCV
